## Git, GitHub

### Q1 - URL of GitHub Repo

My new GitHub Repo in my personal account is https://github.com/bdhansonjr/CS625/tree/main. I created this on github.com & am re-learning the procedural concepts of git.

### Q2 - Pull Command

The git pull command sends remote repository changes to your local machine repository. I believe the pull command shares a similar functionality to the git clone command too.

### Q3 - Local Commits

Based on committing a change via my local machine, I would need to follow this step with a git push command to transfer my updates onto the remote repository on github.com
